        <h1><b>PROJECT INTRODUCTION</b></h1>
        <h4>Folder encryption describes the process of encrypting folders, including files, which means that no one has access and can read the data unless they have a specific decryption key. 
            The purpose is to prevent malicious or unauthorized parties from accessing sensitive data. 
            Folder encryption is a security measure that involves the use of encryption techniques to protect the contents of a specific folder or directory on a computer or storage device. This process ensures that only authorized users with the correct decryption key or password can access the data stored within the encrypted folder.
            There are different types of encryption techniques like symmetric encryption, asymmetric encryption, password-based encryption. Symmetric encryption uses the same key for both encryption and decryption. The challenge is securely sharing the key among authorized users. Asymmetric encryption utilizes a pair of public and private keys. Data encrypted with the public key can only be decrypted with the corresponding private key. Password-based encryption uses a password or passphrase to derive an encryption key. Users need to enter the correct password to access the encrypted folder.

        <h1><b>PROJECT OBJECTIVES</b></h1>
        <h4>
            Input design for folder encryption and decryption is to create a user interface and system behavior that facilitates secure and efficient interaction with the encryption and decryption processes. The input design plays a crucial role in ensuring that users can easily and correctly provide the necessary information to initiate encryption or decryption operations.
            <br>
            1)Design an interface that is intuitive and easy for users to understand.<br>
            2)Validate user input to ensure it meets the required criteria.<br>
            3)Implement effective password handling mechanisms.<br>
            4)Implement secure user authentication mechanisms<br>
            5)Adhere to industry standards and best practices for input handling.<br>
